		<h3> What is your interest in IT? </h3>
		<p> My interest in I.T. mainly resolves around gaming and the process of creating them and understanding how they work.
		Specifically, I am interested in FPS games such as CSGO (Counter Strike-Global Offensive) and for my skill in the game to
		improve I wanted to find out how the game mechanics worked and understand the process of each function within the game.
		Because of this I started looking into the creation of games, coding game and the process of creating them.
		This mainly consisted of movement, bullet inaccuracy and bullet properties. Since then, I have found coding interesting
