			<h3> •What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
			<p> The test results show that I am more of an extroverted than an introvert, 
			this means I tend to be quieter whilst in a group, though I am also observant 
			and act upon logic rather than my own feelings. The results also show that I can 
			be spontaneous rather than plan out everything. On the other hand, the tests 
			indicate I am more likely to get stressed than to resist it although it is within 
			the 56th percentile so it isn't a huge factor. it also indicated that I tend to be 
			more hands on and tend to use trial and error, which may help with refining. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> •How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
			<p> Personally, I think these result wont effect my work ethic within my team, 
			although it may make me try to be less extraverted whilst working on the project. 
			The project itself would preferably be hands on if possible, whilst I may work 
			within a schedule to get more work done rather than being more spontaneous to 
			benefit the team with organisation. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> •How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
			<p> When forming a team, I should find people who are not as extroverted so there can be more 
			communication within the team, as well as potentially finding someone who is more judging 
			to help keep the work scheduled.
