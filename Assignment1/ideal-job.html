			<h3> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. </h3>
			<p> My ideal job would be somewhere along the lines of a game designer. 
			This appeals to me as it is more practical, allowing the use of problem 
			solving and the use of using logic to develop applications. I would also 
			love this job as other people would be able to play the games, hopefully 
			enjoy them, and allow students to learn at the same time. It also of involves 
			the usage of unity or unreal engine to create games, although the use of these 
			specific programs isn't important, I have previously used them and enjoyed doing so. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. </h3>
			<p> Some of the skills that would be required for this job would include the usage of engines such as unity or unreal 
			engine, UX and UI, 3D or 2D modeling and coding. This would be used in level design, web design, and the general 
			creation of the games. The qualifications required for this job would include the ability to use unity or unreal 
			engine, whilst having knowledge on WebGL and cross platform compatibility. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </h3>
			<p> Currently I have experience with both unity and unreal engine and have little experience with both 2D and 3D 
			modeling although they could be improved upon. I have built my own FPS game from scratch and a few 2D arcade 
			style games. On the other hand, I have not done any WebGL or cross platform compatibility though I could learn 
			these skills. For the UX and UI side requirements I am currently studying User Centered Design as a first year 
			student and hope to develop my ability in those areas during my time studying Bachelor of I.T. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience 
			required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, 
			(and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can. </h3>
			<p> For skills such as unity, unreal engine, WebGL 2D/3D modeling and cross platform development skills 
			throughout my time studying at RMIT as my current courses donâ€™t contain these specific fields it is 
			possible for me to study them later. Currently I am studying UI, UX and database concepts during my 
			first year and semester studying so there are many opportunities to further develop my skills. 
			During my off time I could also start my own personal projects and learn more about these skills 
			through tutorials and resources such as w3schools or similar educational sites. </p>
