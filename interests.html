			<h3> What is your interest in IT? </h3>
			<p> As an introvert I spend most of my time in my room playing video games or watching videos, 
			which grew my interest in I.T. Specifically, I grew interested in CS:GO (Counter Strike:Global Offensive) 
			and for my skill in the game to improve I wanted to find out how the game mechanics worked and understand 
			the process of each function within the game. This mainly consisted of movement, bullet inaccuracy and 
			bullet properties, to understand the mechanical ways to improve at the game to eliminate having to rely on 
			reaction time and muscle memory aim. Because of this I started looking into the creation of similar games, 
			some coding involved and the process of creating them. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> When did your interest in IT start? </h3>
			<p> Although my main interest revolves around CS:GO, I grew up in an era where technology was and is constantly evolving, 
			so I have been exposed to technology a lot. My first interest in I.T. was probably my DS Lite where I had many 
			playthroughs of Pokémon games.  </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h3>
			<p> Personally, I don’t believe a particular event or person sparked my interest in I.T. but rather a combined 
			selection of events sparked my interest. Starting from when I was young playing Pokémon on my DS, learning 
			how to dual boot my MacBook Air with windows 10 and taking elective classes including I.T. But most importantly 
			being the youngest child in the family so my parents reply upon me for their technology problems. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
			<p> My experience in studying I.T. (besides playing video games) began during year 9 when I had a project 
			“Personal Best” where I decided to create my own first-person shooter game from scratch. Also, 
			during year 9 I took an elective course called “game making” where we created an assortment of games 
			including side scrollers and platformers, but also “multimedia” where we learnt some features in photoshop 
			and adobe premiere. In year 10 I took a class in coding where I learnt some basic python and coded my own 
			song picker and randomizer program. During year 11 I continued doing this class where I once again did some 
			python whilst also learning VB.net in visual studio, creating basic arcade style games and programs such as 
			calculators and data type inputs with type and range checks (validation).</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
			<p> I chose to study at RMIT as I found lots of positive feedback for the I.T. courses as well as the facilities. 
			During my time deciding my brother was also studying at RMIT so our daily commutes could be easier traveling 
			in 1 car to save time and money. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
			<p> While studying at RMIT I would like to further develop my skills in coding and problem solving, 
			although I don’t expect to be able to create a whole advanced program by myself, I would like to 
			be able to contribute to the process of one, being able to make my own code and read other sources 
			of code and understand them.
